ListMaker 2000
**SI669 Fall 2020**

## Video Walkthrough
See the [Demo Video](https://tinyurl.com/9ybdzswd).

## Learning Goals
Practice working with CRUD and Firebase.

## Project Goals
Connet Listmaker 2000 to connect to Firebase, so that all changes made in the app are made persistent across launches of the app.


## Notes
* Be sure to show that the effects of all types of data modification (create, update, delete) persist across app launches.
* :exclamation: You don't need to show the Firebase console in your video as the one in Demo Videos. Showing just your phone screen will be adequate.
